# Motivation
Needed to learn JS for work and thought that making a game would be a fun way of doing it!

# Questions
Q: Why does the grid not fit my screen?
A: I tried to make the app mobile first, and by doing that broke the sizing on desktop. To fix this make the window smaller ðŸ˜‰ (a feature not a bug, promise).
